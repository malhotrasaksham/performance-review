# performance-review
An angular project to request and manage feedbacks for users.

It assumes admin login as `admin` and 5 user logins as `rob`, `john`, `tim`, `josh` and `ryan`

As an admin, it can currently assign feedbacks to users and view the submitted feedbacks.

As a user, one can save a feedback as draft or submit the feedback.

It mocks all the backend via services and has no separate backend.

THe project can be improved a lot by adding features like `feedbacks per year`, `manage users`, `multiple roles for users`, `using session to persists login` and many more.
